  "description": "The volume agents have a different operating model to other types of agents. Their main focus is on appeals, with a stated aim to appeal in almost all instances, unless they know of a clear reason that the rateable value of the client's property will increase. They rely on the client to volunteer this information, so less informed or engaged clients could still be at risk of an increase in their rates bill. Volume agents work predominately with SMEs and have an upper and lower threshold of rateable value that they will typically take on. This means that they tend to be targeting occupiers of single properties. When it comes to targeting, they have a distinct sales function who can be very aggressive in their recruitment of clients. Other agents have suggested that they are not averse to attempting to poach their clients with promises of rates reductions thought to be very unrealistic. They bemoan the lack of engagement from the VOA, whilst tacitly acknowledging their own part in creating the workload the VOA currently experiences.",
  "representative_quote": "We feel a lot of pain working to the VOA's current ways. We also can see the referencers, caseworkers, valuers etc are mostly good guys caught in the middle.",

    "Keep internal appeal targets met"

  "profile": [
    "Very sales focused, which governs much of how they behave as a business",
    "Will appeal all cases regardless of merit. The only exception is when the client has shared information that suggests the RV could go up.",
    "Only deal with appeals and don't handle other property services",
    "Work on a no-win no-fee basis",
    "The majority of their clients are within the bulk classes of property",
    "Have few large clients and mostly deal with SMEs",
    "Have a threshold of rateable value - avoid the smallest properties and don't target the largest RVs",
    "Their clients tend to be single property occupiers",
    "They feel that they pay much better than the VOA and this is why they attract ex-VOA staff",
    "Have dedicated sales teams who cold call to recruit clients",
    "Monitor the success of professional agents and then use marketing teams to target similar businesses in the area",
    "Reluctant to withdraw cases owing to internal targets",
    "Will push the VOA to go to tribunal",
    "Appeal everything, which can cause client RV to increase"

Pragmatic about the system - sees it as a numbers game. Acknowledges frustrations with the VOA while being aware of their own contribution to the problem."
