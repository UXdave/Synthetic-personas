  "description": "Professional agents are the most common type of agent. They will always be professionally qualified and act as trusted advisors to their clients. They are a broad group and within that there is a lot of variety. Some will employ 100 people across multiple locations, others will employ one to two people in a single location. They are likely to have a mix of large and small clients. Large clients will be few in number but make up much of their work, small clients will be high in number but provide less work and revenue. Many of these agents are very experienced and have dealt with the VOA for many years. The changes the VOA have gone through has impacted the professional agent as much as VOA staff. Professional agents preferred the old way of working with the VOA, where collaboration and negotiation with professionally qualified people was the way to solve a case.",

  "profile": [
    "Professional agents vary in size from lone operators to large multi-office firms. Their size influences their client mix.",
    "All professional agents will work with a mix of large corporate clients and SMEs. The larger agents will tend to have a greater number of larger clients.",
    "The larger the agent, the more cases they will have active. Even smaller agents can have more than 100 cases active at any time.",
    "Some cases are not profitable, which is a particular problem for the smaller agents.",
    "Not all cases go to appeal, but the number is increasing.",
    "They draw business from repeat business, direct contact from referral or reputation, and sales activity.",
    "The majority of work is on a no-win no-fee basis, preferred by corporates.",
    "Smaller agents may charge upfront fees in some instances.",
    "The larger agents in particular feel that they have a better property database than the VOA.",
    "Regardless of size, they all report spending a lot of time trying to move things forward."

  "voa_interactions": [
    "The changes the VOA has gone through has made their job harder",
    "It can be hard to speak to anyone at the VOA about a case - they used to be able to pick up the phone and speak to someone",
    "It's much more difficult to negotiate a reduction. The VOA aren't as flexible as they used to be",
    "Most cases are settled before the Valuation Tribunal. Ideally they would like to solve cases during the discussion phase.",
    "They favour phone contact, resorting to email if they can't get an answer",
    "They feel that if they do get to talk to or meet the Valuation Officer they can normally reach agreement",
    "They have a mixed view of VOA staff. Most VOA people are felt to be nice, but some less so.",
    "For specialist properties they tend to be dealing with the same people",
    "They note that VOA people seem depressed and down-trodden",
    "They notice that caseworkers are overworked",
    "They know which caseworkers are open to negotiation and which are not",
    "Owing to a selective approach to which cases they appeal, they feel that they are often successful at court",
    "If the VOA are making a site visit they will try to be there too. They estimate that 75% of the time the VOA do not inspect.",
    "They report a trend that if the VOA do engage, it's mostly via email",
    "There is a feeling that the way in which they used to work with the VOA was a case of professionals working together. It feels like this has gone now."
