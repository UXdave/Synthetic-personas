  "description": "In the NDR space, unrepresented customers are a smaller group than those who opt to use an agent, with around 10% of businesses choosing to deal with ratings themselves. Some opt to do this as they feel that the cost of using an agent is prohibitive, whereas others feel that they have the wherewithal to navigate the ratings system without support. Their knowledge of VOA processes and policies is much less detailed than that of agents. Consequently their need for support and guidance from the VOA is significantly increased. Members of this audience group are very broad in terms of business type, covering all of the bulk classes of property: offices, shops, workshops and warehouses. In the main, businesses are operating out of a single premises, with only property developers dealing with several properties at any one time.",
