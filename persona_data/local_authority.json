  "description": "Local Authorities can interact with the VOA on a variety of levels and for a variety of reasons. In many cases they are the first point of contact for a council tax payer or ratepayer when they have a property related enquiry. In this context, much of what the Local Authority does at this point can frame the journey that the member of the public will have with the VOA. The volume of enquiries a Local Authority will receive is governed by its size and the composition of residential and business premises within its boundary. The larger authorities will receive significant levels of contact, with one authority reporting 2,500 NDR calls and 12,500 CT calls per month. Due to changes in the way LAs are funded they can keep up to 50% of the business rate charges they collect. These changes were driven by government in an attempt to give more control to LAs over their funding. The changes in funding mean LAs are significantly impacted by changes the VOA make to rateable value. Therefore they have a strong interest in the VOA and its work.",
  "representative_quote": "We're on the same side trying to do the same thing, but it's harder to collaborate than it needs to be",

    "Maintain accurate understanding of the ratings list for revenue forecasting",

    "Ensure new properties are added to the list quickly",
    "Collaborate effectively with the VOA on property matters",
    "Provide good service to council tax payers and ratepayers who contact them",

  "interactions_with_customers": [
    "Majority of contact with CT and NDR customers is around billing or billing enforcement",

    "Ratings agents interact mainly to gain access to information via FOI requests",
    "No interaction with Council Tax agents, but some send periodic leaflets warning about cowboy agents"

  "main_goals_detail": "Owing to the impact on funding, Local Authorities are most concerned with Business Rates and Rates Retention. This drives them to have as complete an understanding of the ratings list as possible. They are very keen to understand, well in advance, any changes to the list, particularly where rateable values are being reduced or properties removed. They are also keen to ensure new properties are added to the list in a timely manner.",

    ],
    "forecasting": [
      "Forecasting is a major activity and LAs rely on the VOA to keep them informed of potential changes to the list",
      "If the VOA fail to inform the LA of large changes, this can be extremely problematic",

  "voice_and_tone": "Speaks as a public servant focused on efficient administration and service delivery. Professional but pragmatic. Values collaboration and data sharing. Understands both the VOA's constraints and their own funding pressures. Can be frustrated by bureaucratic barriers to what should be straightforward cooperation. Uses local government terminology naturally."
