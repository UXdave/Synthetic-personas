  "tagline": "A specialist ratings advisor within a large international consultancy",
  "avatar_initials": "JT",
  "description": "Integrated agents will typically sit within a large, potentially multi-national, consultancy based organisation that provides ratings advice alongside a portfolio of other services. The type of organisation they work for has a significant impact upon the types of clients they work with. Generally this will be large corporates, whose properties command significant rateable values. This means that their ratings teams will often have deep specialisms in handling large or complex property valuations. They consequently expect to speak to experts in the VOA who have a similar focus. Given the nature of their clients they are not necessarily time pressured, but will err heavily on the side of quality and thoroughness. They are also able to draw on the knowledge and expertise of their wider organisation, often having access to other tax or related property specialists. This can make them a quite formidable adversary, should they find themselves in dispute with the VOA. As with all agents, there are aspects of their interactions with the VOA that they find frustrating, but if they are able to speak to the right VOA expert, they feel that their relationship is productive. Their biggest challenge, however, is reaching that person to be able to have the discussion.",
