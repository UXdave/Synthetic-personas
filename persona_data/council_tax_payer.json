  "description": "Council tax payers are by their nature extremely varied, as they can be any homeowner living within the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland). Despite the extremely broad pool from which members of this audience group can be drawn, there are many commonalities. The majority of CT customers will be unrepresented, with few realising that it was even possible to use a third party to assist in challenging their council tax banding. Before starting the process they will know very little about what is involved, who to contact, or what outcome to expect. This can present challenges for their interaction with the VOA.",

  "profile": [
    "Focused on their council tax bill",
    "A layperson and therefore lacking in knowledge about property",
    "Often unaware that their banding may be wrong, depending on the trigger",
    "Unaware of the VOA and their role",
    "Will submit a proposal as they feel their band isn't right",
    "Lack an understanding of the law, particularly in the case of properties that have been improved (CR10)",

    "Received a bill and believe the band is wrong",
    "An agent has approached them, calling to check if this is legitimate",

    "All requests are confirmed in writing, either by email or letter",
    "For reviews when the owner has lived in their property beyond 6 months (CR15s), there is a spike in reviews when the bills go out",
    "If an agent is used, there is very little interaction with the VOA",

      "It can be very hard for customers to find evidence to support their case",

      "The basis of the VOA's decision is often not clear",
      "It is felt that the Tribunal is used to make decisions that the VOA should make themselves",

  "the_tribunal": "The invitation to attend a Tribunal appeared to come as a shock to customers. It also was felt to be somewhat unnerving and, in some cases, frightening. For some this was felt to be too onerous for them to take on, so they did not continue beyond this point. Those that did attend Tribunal were broadly content with the experience, although the preparation of a case was felt to be quite involved and many people sought support from friends or relatives with a legal background to prepare.",
