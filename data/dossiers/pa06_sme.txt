EVERYTHING JUST TAKES
TOO LONG
IN THE NDR SPACE, UNREPRESENTED CUSTOMERS ARE A SMALLER GROUP THAN THOSE WHO OPT TO USE AN AGENT,
WITH AROUND 10% OF BUSINESSES CHOOSING TO DEAL WITH RATINGS THEMSELVES. SOME OPT TO DO THIS AS THEY
FEEL THAT THE COST OF USING AN AGENT IS PROHIBITIVE, WHEREAS OTHERS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL
TO NAVIGATE THE RATINGS SYSTEM WITHOUT SUPPORT. IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF VOA PROCESSES
GUIDANCE FROM THE VOA IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED.
MEMBERS OF THIS AUDIENCE GROUP ARE VERY BROAD IN TERMS OF BUSINESS TYPE, COVERING ALL OF THE BULK
CLASSES OF PROPERTY; OFFICES, SHOPS, WORKSHOPS AND WAREHOUSES. IN THE MAIN, BUSINESSES ARE OPERATING
OUT OF A SINGLE PREMISES, WITH ONLY PROPERTY DEVELOPERS DEALING WITH SEVERAL PROPERTIES AT ANY ONE TIME.
Motivations to appeal
Typically, SMEs believe that their rates are too high
when compared to other similar properties or simply
too high in general. They are often well informed
about the nature of other businesses' premises and
have used the VOA website to understand how their
RV compares. It is unclear from this research just
how much discussion SMEs have with operators of
similar businesses, but none of those consulted
mentioned speaking to their peers.
Knowledge of ratings
This falls across a broad spectrum. Sole traders
tended to be the least knowledgeable, with time
pressure being cited as the main reason for not being
able to find out more. Within the larger SMEs, there
was either prior experience of dealing with the VOA,
or responsibility fell to an employee with the time and
resource to find out more.
Starting the appeal
Many SMEs started their appeal using the VOA
website. In general the quantity and quality of
information on the website was well liked and most
SMEs felt that it was a good resource.
Collecting evidence
In most cases SMEs felt able to gather the evidence
needed to support their appeal. The main problem
was the amount of time that this took, particularly as
this was time that could be being used to run and
develop their business.
Progress through the appeal
The majority of SMEs reported issues in
understanding where their appeal had got to within
the VOA process. It was felt that they had to chase the
VOA for updates and it was often quite challenging to
get in contact with their caseworker.
SMEs also felt that the time their appeal took was
typically far too long. The majority of SMEs found that
their case took longer than a year to resolve, with
some cases taking several years to reach a
resolution. For some the financial consequences of
this were quite severe.
Understanding the VOA's case
Many SMEs found it difficult to understand the basis
for the VOA's decisions. The way in which the VOA
shared their evidence at the very end of the process
wasn't thought to be particularly helpful or fair.
Negotiating with the VOA
Views on negotiation were very mixed. Several SMEs
reported being able to have a productive discussion
with the VOA and reach an acceptable compromise.
Typically this would only happen close to the date of a
Valuation Tribunal. Other SMEs indicated that they
had much more difficulty. In these cases, they would
struggle to get in touch with the VOA, receive little in
the way of communication and once contact was
achieved, face resistance from the VOA in agreeing
any form of reduction. SMEs suggest that even when
presented with evidence that proved their case, the
VOA was reluctant to make any concessions. In these
cases, the matter was either escalated to a more
senior person within the VOA who could over-rule
their colleague, or the matter was left for the
Valuation Tribunal to resolve.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE IF I HAD TO
GO THROUGH IT MYSELF
REPRESENTED CUSTOMER
SMEs most valued:
¥ Being able to talk to someone at the VOA and
discuss the specifics of their case.
¥ Being able to have an inspection, if they felt this
was necessary.
¥ Speaking to people who knew their area and the
specifics of their property.
SMEs were most frustrated by:
¥ Not understanding how the appeals process
worked.
¥ Not understanding the basis of the VOA's case.
¥ Not being able to easily talk to someone at the VOA
about their case.
¥ The amount of time cases took to reach a
conclusion.
Goals:
¥ To reduce my business rates.
¥ Understand how my rateable value is calculated
¥ Respond to a request for information.
¥ Provide an update due to a change in
circumstance.
¥ Make temporary change in circumstance.
¥ Started a new business and want to know what the
rateable value is.
Profile:
¥ Typically operating a business property in one of
the bulk classes; shops, offices, factories,
warehouses. Other common property types include
pubs, storage and schools.
¥ Just see rates as another bill, often seeing their
rates and rent as a single cost.
¥ Struggle to understand rateable value and how it is
calculated.
¥ Believe that the appeals process is difficult.
¥ Once started, they will often complete the process
on their own without an agent.
¥ Some businesses will pick and choose when to use
agents, typically for more complex cases.
¥ The role of the Local Authority in rates is not well
understood, particularly for smaller businesses.
¥ Time poor, as their main focus is running their
business.
¥ Depending on how well the process has gone, they
may well be angry with the VOA and require
calming.
¥ Rating is more problematic for single property
occupiers, especially when it comes to time and
expertise.
¥ For larger businesses, ratings work is likely to be
handled by an employee entrusted to finance
matters.
¥ Publicans seem to be most hassled by volume and
cowboy agents. Those contacting the VOA may well
be in financial distress too.
¥ The process can be very stressful for one person
businesses.
¥ Small Business Relief can be a motivator to
appeal, particularly when close to the £12K
threshold.
¥ CVS client:
¥ Not happy with ongoing 50% charge.
¥ However, the appeal was won and the
service was acceptable.
Interaction with the VOA:
¥ When they call, they expect to get an answer there
and then.
¥ They can call in to ask for help to fill in forms or to
start their appeal.
¥ Ratepayer lack of knowledge means they need a lot
of hand holding. It seems that this is not always
available.
¥ Some ratepayers do get a visit from the VOA, which
is always appreciated.
¥ They like to talk directly to the VOA for clarification.
¥ First contact calls are relaxed, as they are mainly
trying to understand the process or seeking help.
¥ Ratepayers are often confused by process and
terminology used by the VOA.
¥ Negotiation can be hard as the focus is on price,
not the reasons for the Rateable Value.
¥ Interactions tend to be positive, if it's possible for
the ratepayer to speak to someone.
¥ The VOA don't keep ratepayers up to date as well
as they would like. They feel they have to chase for
any updates.
¥ Ratepayers like that it is possible to appeal online.
¥ In many cases it can be easier to get to speak to
the VOA than the council.
Frustrations:
General:
¥ Rates are seen as unfair.
¥ Neither the LA or VOA promote Small Business
Relief.
Website and paper communications:
¥ It is hard to find forms on the gov.uk site
¥ The letters sent with the FOR are intimidating
¥ The FOR form itself is confusing
¥ FOR completion is often left to the last minute
¥ It can be a struggle to use the Rateable Value
postcode search in the web tool
¥ The VOA website doesn't explain things in easy to
understand terms
Calls and contact centre:
¥ There is confusion between the role of the VOA and
that of the Local Authority
¥ It can be hard for ratepayers to wait for a call-back,
as they have a business to run
¥ Ratepayers would prefer to get an answer when
speaking to Tier 1, rather than have to wait for a
call-back
¥ The contact centre are unable to provide updates
on the progress of a case
¥ Small businesses are more likely to phone
Progress and updates:
¥ Generally ratepayers do not get updates from the
¥ There is a feeling that everything takes too long,
with cases taking a very long time to resolve
¥ It's very hard to get to speak to someone to
understand what, if any, progress has been made
on a case
¥ Negotiation and agreement only really happens c
lose to Tribunal
Understanding the process and RV:
¥ Ratepayers can be intimidated by VOA legal
language
¥ VOA terminology is hard to understand, particularly
for laypeople.
¥ Rate bills can be hard to understand. Sometimes
they are felt to be incomprehensible
¥ Both the VOA and the Local Authority explain very
little of the process
¥ Sometimes the ratepayer will remain unaware of
why the VOA thinks that their valuation is correct
¥ The basis of the VOA's case is often not clear. "Why
can't they tell me why my rates are what they are?"
¥ Rates can scale depending on the size of the
property. The means by how this works is not well
understood.
Inspections:
¥ Ratepayers want an inspection and are surprised
when this doesn't happen
¥ Public Houses in particular feel that an inspection
is very important. There is deep frustration if this
doesn't happen.
¥ The VOA don't inspect as much as people would
like. "I want to show them why my case is different"
VOA can't / won't help:
¥ Disruptions/change of circumstances can be very
emotive for ratepayers. Especially when the VOA
cannot help
¥ The VOA are felt to have "made up their mind" and
won't change their position. Even if compelling
evidence is presented.
¥ The VOA don't keep the same hours as businesses.
"They're always at lunch or on a break"
¥ There is extreme frustration when the VOA won't
recognise current trading conditions
¥ The recent ruling on empty properties is felt to be
unfair
¥ The VOA aren't felt to be accountable when they
make mistakes
¥ Sometimes large attachments don't make it
through
¥ The Local Authority can hound ratepayers for
payments. This is particularly frustrating if the VOA
takes a long time to do anything
¥ The Local Authority always have to hand the
ratepayer to the VOA. Ratepayers question why the
Local Authority can't interface more with the VOA
¥ The VOA and the Local Authority are often not
joined up, providing mixed messages.
Tribunal:
¥ The requirements for the tribunal are not clear and
the need to attend can often come as a surprise.
¥ The statement of case can feel onerous. It seems
to ratepayers that they must seek legal help.
¥ It feels that appeals are being used for things that
should be simple to resolve.
¥ Attending a hearing is a big problem for small
businesses, as they may have to shut for the day,
with a consequent loss in earnings.
¥ Having to go through tribunal for things felt to be
resolvable with a conversation baffles ratepayers
¥ Rescheduled tribunals can be a long time away.
VOA staffing and internal process
¥ Caseworkers change a lot. It can feel to ratepayers
like they have to start from scratch each time.
¥ The increasing lack of local knowledge on the
VOA's part is felt to be a large concern
¥ Junior caseworkers are felt to be more prone to
error and less willing to back down. They have to
be overridden by senior caseworkers
Needs:
¥ Help and guidance on all aspects of the process
¥ Being kept informed about progress
¥ A quick and efficient service. "Why must it take so
long"
¥ More help with providing the correct information
for a proposal
¥ More help in understanding how the process works
and what is involved. Particularly for small
¥ To be able to find and understand key information
on the rates search site, including; property size,
value, parking spaces, other property "upgrades"
For most SMEs dealing with the VOA is business
as usual. But for some it can come at a time of
high stress. Although low in numbers, high stress
SMEs are big in impact on the VOA, VOA staff and
come at a difficult time for the SME business
owner.
In building our understanding of SME customers
it is important that we understand the high stress

A journey map shows the path that a customer takes to achieve a
specific goal. The map shows all the steps that the customer takes
from the point at which their journey begins, through to when their
goal is achieved, and in some cases illustrating what may happen
beyond that point. This is often referred to as an end-to-end
journey.
Rather than consider a journey as beginning when a customer
comes into contact with the VOA, our end-to-end journeys consider
the totality of the experience, starting from the trigger that caused
the customer to begin their journey, through any interactions they
may have with other organisations or media before arriving at the
VOA. The journeys then cover all the interaction points with the
VOA, both online and offline, before either concluding or moving
beyond the VOA into interaction with other organisations.
There are a number of key components to the journey maps:
¥ Narrative: a description of the interaction that is occurring at key
points during the journey.
¥ Roles: they key people with whom the customer will interact on
their journey. On the journey maps these are shown as the
horizontal lines across the map.
¥ Channels: these are the different routes through which the
customer can interact with the VOA. This could include the
contact centre, the website, direct contact with caseworkers and
so on. Each interaction point in a specific channel is marked as a
node on the journey map.
¥ Path: the route taken through the journey.
¥ VOA documents: any documentation or online reference sources
that the customer will see during their journey. Any issues with
these sources will be detailed.
¥ Emotions: this illustrates how the customer, and other key roles,
are feeling during the process. This is where the main point
points in a journey will be captured, typically coinciding with the
more negative emotional states.
¥ VOA objectives: this section describes any VOA objectives that
result in the journey proceeding as it does. It is important to bear
these in mind when changes to the journey are considered to
ensure that changes address both VOA and customer needs.
By understanding the journey that a customer goes on when
interacting with the VOA, we can identify the key pain points, those
areas where interaction is more difficult than it needs to be, any
areas of inefficiency and highlight any unintended or unanticipated
interactions. By viewing the journeys from a role perspective, we
can also understand how much communication and guidance the
customer receives from the VOA during their journey, which has
been a recurring issue identified throughout our research.
