VOA's SoC can contain evidence that we're not
aware of and can change the path of the
appeal.
¥ It takes time to collect evidence for a SoC.
¥ Getting evidence comes down to personal
contacts.
Sometimes the margin is too small and the
effort to go to appeal means it isn't financially
worth it.
¥ If a reduction is over 5% then the VOA won't
sign it off without going to tribunal.
¥ The VOA cherry picks the information they
want to share.
¥ The VOA do everything they can to keep the RV
as high as they can.
¥ If we don't know the basis of the VOA case how
can we negotiate?
¥ Even on simple cases you have to appeal with
all the effort that goes with that.
The VOA say they are fair but they are not. They
used to be.
¥ Having our cases passed around internally in
the VOA is a huge frustration and causes
issues as case knowledge is lost.
¥ Our clients get very frustrated with the
process.
¥ The VOA are far more process driven than they
used to be. They no longer think sensibly.
¥ The VOA are under resourced.
¥ Some in the VOA take delight in hiding behind
regulations.
¥ The VOA make simple cases difficult. They put
things in for appeal when it is clear the rates
are wrong.
¥ The VOA has a culture of fear. Staff are not
empowered and they are scared of giving
discounts.
¥ Even when we are in agreement it can take far
too long for this to be actioned.
¥ The VOA will under value to protect against
appeals.
¥ Some cases take time to be allocated. We have
no idea who to deal with while this is going on.
¥ There is a huge backlog of cases and we think
that in certain instances the VOA are
purposefully not listing things. This has been
exacerbated by the edict from George Osborne
to fix the backlog. The VOA is too focused on
hitting this target reduction.
¥ The VOA data should really include GPS
coordinates, as it can sometimes be hard to
locate a property exactly
¥ The way that the VOA website captures
addresses doesn't always reflect how
addresses are structured. This can make it
harder to find properties in the system.
¥ Feel that valuers are reluctant to make
professional judgements and would prefer the
VT decided for them.
¥ Proposals will often get made invalid for no
good reason. It can be very hard to work out
why and make the necessary corrections or
challenge the reasoning. Maybe this is a
delaying tactic?
¥ Feel that the properties they represent
contribute a much more significant proportion
of RV than those of smaller organisations. If all
cases are treated equally, they end up with a
poor service that feels unwarranted.
¥ There is a concern that valuers can act
unprofessionally. Either by:
¥ Under-valuing properties to protect
against future reductions so an
increase can be threatened if the
ratepayer appeals
¥ Adding the wrong things to valuations to
protect against reductions.
¥ Hiding line items of a valuation within
¥ Feel that people are under pressure not
to lose too much value out of the list
rather than to achieve the correct
valuation.
¥ The VOA treats every case as the same and
won't prioritise the more complex ones.
PROCESS
STATEMENT OF CASE
It is very hard to get hold of a case worker. It is
just as hard to get a reply. It can feel like case
workers are hiding from you.
¥ The lack of communication puts pressure on
everyone.
¥ When you make your appeal you cannot give
your client any idea on the date it will be
heard.
¥ We often have to escalate to get a result. This
takes a lot of hard work and time.
¥ The VOA call centre system is frustrating."I
want to talk to the case worker that wrote to
me but I can't be put through and have to wait
for a call back from someone to tell me they
can't help me and to arrange for the person I
called for to call me."
¥ Direct dials are rarely given out.
¥ We are not told when our case workers go on
holiday. When they go away work on our cases
stops.
¥ Too much information is forgotten about or
lost.
¥ It is hard to get hold of anyone after 4pm.
¥ We give no information in proposals because
we don't have to. When we have provided the
information the VOA aren't interested anyway.
It's getting harder to have a productive
discussion to reach an agreement. VOA staff
are reluctant to talk to us.
¥ Feel that you have to put in an appeal to get
anyone at the VOA to speak to you. This has
made things much more adversarial.
¥ The VOA are reluctant to engage beyond the
target date. Simply respond, "we await your
case".
¥ Even if we have the correct contact details,
phones ring out and email inboxes bounce our
emails.
It costs a lot of money to go to tribunal £100k.
¥ The VT panel are not property specialists and
can not always see compelling evidence for
what it is. Therefore there are a lot of wrong
decisions made.
¥ When a case gets a tribunal date it comes out of
the blue and it is all systems go. This is
demanding on us and sometimes our clients.
Some cases take years to get to VT.
¥ Sometimes the VOA send people who know
nothing about the case to tribunal.
Valuation Tribunals have targets on listings, not
on resolutions. This colours how things work.
¥ Volume agents ride on the back of our work.
Once we get a win they exploit it in the area via
their marketing team.
¥ Worry that the blanket appeals type of agents
have put the VOA under such pressure that
they've gone into a defensive mode. Also
concerned that they've yet to develop a strategy
to combat them.
¥ There is a concern that the VOA now think that
all agents are crooks.
COMMUNICATION
VALUATION
TRIBUNAL
VOLUME AGENTS
¥ Feel that the knowledge base of the VOA is in
decline.
Younger VOA staff are not well skilled and
don't know what they are talking about.
Feel that the VOA workforce is becoming less
skilled. This can make first contact more
difficult.
¥ The local knowledge has gone. VOA staff used
to know a property and its rating history. This
made discussions much more productive. Now
a case may go to Tribunal as a consequence
when agreement could have been reached, or
go around the loop until someone with the
right expertise is assigned to the case.
¥ We don't have access to the rental information
the VOA has used to decide their valuation.
This makes it hard to understand if the RV is
correct.
In the NDR space, the primary audience
group that the VOA interacts with is that of
ratings agents. Around 90% of NDR payers
are represented by an agent, which makes
this an important group to understand. The
agent marketplace is quite varied however,
ranging from lone surveyors, up to
multi-national consultancy firms who
provide ratings advice as just one of many
property related services.
Recognising this variation, it would be less
useful to have a single agent persona, as
whilst there are many common needs, there
are some important differences. During the
course of our research we have identified
four different categories of agents:

target. This illustrates why there us such tension between Volume

PROFILE
¥ They are very sales focused, which governs much
of how they behave as a business.
¥ They will appeal all cases regardless of merit. The
only exception is in instances where the client has
shared information that suggests the RV could go
¥ They only deal with appeals and don't handle other
property services.
¥ They work on a no-win no-fee basis.
¥ The majority of their clients are within the bulk
classes of property.
¥ They have few large clients and mostly deal with
SMEs. They have a threshold of rateable value and
so avoid the smallest properties and don't target
the largest RVs.
¥ Their clients will tend to be single property
occupiers.
¥ They do have some "prestige" clients, but these are
the exception.
¥ They feel that they pay much better than the VOA
and this is why they attract ex-VOA staff.
¥ Their business is split into three teams:
¥ Client Services
¥ Surveyors, most of whom are chartered
¥ They are attempting to broaden their business
focus, but this is very much a work in progress.
¥ Most of their work is driven by templates. This is
how they are able to generate a large volume of
¥ Their business is won via cold calling in the main.
They use the VOA website to determine who to
target.
¥ They aren't very interested in responding to ITTs,
owing to the effort they involve and the lower
chances of success.
THE VOLUME AGENTS HAVE A DIFFERENT OPERATING MODEL TO OTHER TYPES OF AGENTS. THEIR MAIN FOCUS IS ON
APPEALS, WITH A STATED AIM TO APPEAL IN ALMOST ALL INSTANCES, UNLESS THEY KNOW OF A CLEAR REASON THAT
THE RATEABLE VALUE OF THE CLIENT'S PROPERTY WILL INCREASE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THEY WILL RELY ON THE
CLIENT TO VOLUNTEER THIS INFORMATION, SO LESS INFORMED OR ENGAGED CLIENTS COULD STILL BE AT RISK OF AN
INCREASE IN THEIR RATES BILL.
VOLUME AGENTS WORK PREDOMINATELY WITH SMES AND HAVE AN UPPER AND LOWER THRESHOLD OF RATEABLE VALUE
IN THEIR RECRUITMENT OF CLIENTS. OTHER AGENTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY ARE NOT AVERSE TO ATTEMPTING TO
POACH THEIR CLIENTS WITH PROMISES OF RATES REDUCTIONS THOUGHT TO BE VERY UNREALISTIC.
THEY BEMOAN THE LACK OF ENGAGEMENT FROM THE VOA, WHILST TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR OWN PART IN
CREATING THE WORKLOAD THE VOA CURRENTLY EXPERIENCES. THEY ALSO WORRY ABOUT A PERCEIVED SKILLS DRAIN
FOR THE VOA TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH.
WE WILL ALWAYS APPEAL
VOA INTERACTIONS CONTINUED
¥ To aid communication with the VOA they maintain a
list of VOA contacts. This represents their route into
the organisation, regardless of whether a specific
contact is the right one.
¥ Despite this, they struggle to make contact with the
VOA. Feeling that getting in contact is akin to
"bashing through".
¥ Most of their interaction is by phone or email
¥ For an appeal they will only provide:
¥ The name of the business
¥ The address
¥ The stock phrase that says the rent is too
high
¥ They feel that all agents use this same approach
and same stock phrase when it comes to appeals.
¥ They suggest that there is variation between VOA
offices in willingness to negotiate beyond the target
date. They will target the ones that they know are
more likely to do a deal.
¥ The most meaningful interaction for them is when
the VOA shares their case.
¥ The VOA website is felt to be good, but can be
unreliable.
CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS
¥ They sell by cold calling. Often this approach is
aggressive, with ratepayers reporting being con
tacted on a regular basis.
¥ They believe that most of their customers have no
idea about how rating works.
¥ Communication with their clients is mostly handled
by their Client Services team. This keeps their
"professional" employees remote from some of
their sharper practices.
¥ They send out a quarterly newsletter to keep
clients engaged.
¥ When asking the client for property information the
client will provide:
¥ Trading details
¥ Rates bills
¥ The client is also asked to fill out a custom version
of a Form of Return that the agent has created.
¥ Properties are only inspected after the VOA has
acknowledged the case. This differs to how other
types of agent approach inspections.
¥ Clients are signed up to the next list as a matter of
course. Clients are often not aware that this has
happened.
¥ In common with the professional agents, they feel
that a lot of their clients' businesses are marginal
and RV reductions could save them
¥ They maintain their own database of rent details
and feel that in some instances they know more
about rental detail than the VOA.
OTHER INTERACTIONS
¥ They will liaise with other agents to share evidence.
Particularly for multi-floor multi-occupancy
offices.
¥ They meet regularly with the Valuation Tribunal to
discuss upcoming cases and groupings of cases.
NEEDS AND WANTS
¥ The VOA to engage to resolve the case one way or
another.
¥ To reach a resolution before preparation of a
Statement of Case is necessary. They are keen to
avoid the effort this involves.
¥ They would like better access to the VOA's rental
information.
WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH
THE VOA, THE VOA DOESN'T
WANT TO ENGAGE WITH US
A journey map shows the path that a customer takes to achieve a
specific goal. The map shows all the steps that the customer takes
from the point at which their journey begins, through to when their
goal is achieved, and in some cases illustrating what may happen
beyond that point. This is often referred to as an end-to-end
journey.
Rather than consider a journey as beginning when a customer
comes into contact with the VOA, our end-to-end journeys consider
the totality of the experience, starting from the trigger that caused
the customer to begin their journey, through any interactions they
may have with other organisations or media before arriving at the
VOA. The journeys then cover all the interaction points with the
VOA, both online and offline, before either concluding or moving
beyond the VOA into interaction with other organisations.
There are a number of key components to the journey maps:
¥ Narrative: a description of the interaction that is occurring at key
points during the journey.
¥ Roles: they key people with whom the customer will interact on
their journey. On the journey maps these are shown as the
horizontal lines across the map.
¥ Channels: these are the different routes through which the
customer can interact with the VOA. This could include the
contact centre, the website, direct contact with caseworkers and
so on. Each interaction point in a specific channel is marked as a
node on the journey map.
¥ Path: the route taken through the journey.
¥ VOA documents: any documentation or online reference sources
that the customer will see during their journey. Any issues with
these sources will be detailed.
¥ Emotions: this illustrates how the customer, and other key roles,
are feeling during the process. This is where the main point
points in a journey will be captured, typically coinciding with the
more negative emotional states.
¥ VOA objectives: this section describes any VOA objectives that
result in the journey proceeding as it does. It is important to bear
these in mind when changes to the journey are considered to
ensure that changes address both VOA and customer needs.
By understanding the journey that a customer goes on when
interacting with the VOA, we can identify the key pain points, those
areas where interaction is more difficult than it needs to be, any
areas of inefficiency and highlight any unintended or unanticipated
interactions. By viewing the journeys from a role perspective, we
can also understand how much communication and guidance the
customer receives from the VOA during their journey, which has
been a recurring issue identified throughout our research.
