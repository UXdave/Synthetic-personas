Motivations to appeal
CT customers are prompted to appeal by a realisation
that their council tax band is higher than that of their
neighbours. How they reach this realisation can vary.
In some cases, a discussion with a neighbour will
reveal that their band differs, although this seems to
be in a minority of cases, as people don't interact with
their neighbours to a great extent. This seems to be
the trigger when someone has been living in their
property for a reasonable length of time.
The other, more common, instance, is when the CT
customer moves into a new property and the band is
higher than expected. This causes them to conduct a
cursory review of their neighbourhood to understand
whether other properties have the same banding. In
these instances, many CT customers reported using
the VOA website to investigate neighbours' CT bands.
Knowledge of council tax appeals
Few CT customers had any knowledge of council tax
appeals before starting the process. For many, their
knowledge of how the process worked did not
improve over the course of their journey, with many
reporting confusion as to what was supposed to
happen and when.
COUNCIL TAX PAYER
ROLE:
COUNCIL TAX PAYERS ARE BY THEIR NATURE, EXTREMELY VARIED, AS THEY CAN BE ANY HOMEOWNER LIVING WITHIN THE
UNITED KINGDOM EXCLUDING SCOTLAND. DESPITE THE EXTREMELY BROAD POOL FROM WHICH MEMBERS OF THIS AUDI
ENCE GROUP CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE MANY COMMONALITIES. THE MAJORITY OF CT CUSTOMERS WILL BE UNREPRE
SENTED, WITH FEW REALISING THAT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE TO USE A THIRD PARTY TO ASSIST IN CHALLENGING THEIR
COUNCIL TAX BANDING. BEFORE STARTING THE PROCESS THEY WILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT IS INVOLVED, WHO
TO CONTACT, OR WHAT OUTCOME TO EXPECT. THIS CAN PRESENT CHALLENGES FOR THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE VOA.

Use of agents
Those customers that did use agents tended to do so
speculatively and only if directly approached by the
agent. Even if the agent operated on a no-win no-fee
basis, customers received very little communication
until notification of an outcome. Customers using
agents that charged up-front fees would receive no
further communication following their initial
payment. These customers would need to contact the
VOA themselves to understand whether their case
had been successful.
Starting the review/appeal
The first point of contact when starting an appeal
tends to be the Local Authority. It seems that they will
simply refer the customer to the VOA. Experience of
first contact with the VOA seems to be largely
acceptable, although more could be done to explain
what the process of a review or appeal will entail.
Collecting evidence
Customers reported difficulty when it came to
collecting evidence, particularly in terms of pricing
data for 1991, should they be based in England. There
was a feeling that the VOA had this evidence and was
being unhelpful in not sharing it. This also
contributed to customers feeling very much on their
own and unsupported.
Progress through the review/appeal
Customers were typically unaware of where their
case had got to within the VOA's process. They did not
feel that they had been kept up to date and that if they
wanted to know more they would have to chase the
VOA to find out.
Understanding the VOA's decision
If the VOA decided that the customer's banding was
correct, customers felt that they were provided with
very little information as to why this was the case.
This lead to a sense that the VOA was inflexible and
unwilling to move from their initial position.
Customers reported feeling helpless or "brushed-off"
at this point.
Communicating with the VOA
The majority of customers had very infrequent
communication with the VOA. Customers tended to
appreciate the contact they had with the VOA, but felt
that they needed more. The lack of a decent
explanation or discussion was one of the largest
causes of dissatisfaction for customers. There was
also concern if the property wasn't inspected. In
some instances, customers felt aggrieved that they
hadn't had an opportunity to demonstrate to the VOA
why their property banding was incorrect.
NAME:
JENNIFER DAY
UNITED KINGDOM EXCLUDING SCOTLAND. DESPITE THE EXTREMELY BROAD POOL FROM WHICH MEMBERS OF THIS
AUDIENCE GROUP CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE MANY COMMONALITIES. THE MAJORITY OF CT CUSTOMERS WILL BE
UNREPRESENTED, WITH FEW REALISING THAT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE TO USE A THIRD PARTY TO ASSIST IN
CHALLENGING THEIR COUNCIL TAX BANDING. BEFORE STARTING THE PROCESS THEY WILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT
WHAT IS INVOLVED, WHO TO CONTACT, OR WHAT OUTCOME TO EXPECT. THIS CAN PRESENT CHALLENGES FOR THEIR
INTERACTION WITH THE VOA.
The Tribunal
The invitation to attend a Tribunal appeared to come
as a shock to customers. It also was felt to be
somewhat unnerving and, in some cases, frightening.
For some this was felt to be too onerous for them to
take on, so they did not continue beyond this point.
Those that did attend Tribunal were broadly content
with the experience, although the preparation of a
case was felt to be quite involved and many people
sought support from friends or relatives with a legal
background to prepare.
CT customers most valued:
¥ Contact with someone at the Valuation Office
Agency.
¥ The ability to view neighbours' council tax bands on
the VOA website.
CT customers were most frustrated by:
¥ Not understanding the basis of the VOA's decision.
¥ The lack of communication with the VOA.
¥ The difficulty in finding property data for 1991.
¥ Lack of an inspection.
Goals
¥ Contest a VOA decision I am unhappy with.
¥ Pay council tax.
¥ Understand how my council tax is calculated.
¥ Ensure my council tax banding is accurate.
¥ Reduce my council tax.
¥ Handle the split or merger of my property.
¥ New build with no CT band.
Profile
¥ Focused on their council tax bill.
¥ A layperson and therefore lacking in knowledge
about property.
¥ Often unaware that their banding may be wrong,
depending on the trigger.
¥ Unaware of the VOA and their role.
¥ Will submit a proposal as they feel their band isn't
right.
¥ Lack an understanding of the law. Particularly in
the case of properties that have been improved
¥ May expect the VOA to find/provide the evidence.
They don't want to do this themselves.
Triggers:
¥ Received a bill and believe the band is wrong.
¥ An Agent has approached them. Calling to check if
this is legitimate.
¥ Media driven particularly Martin Lewis.
¥ Being informed by the VOA that their band is
wrong.
¥ Just moved into a new property that had an
extension.
¥ Recently moved into a new build and want a bill.
¥ Word of mouth. News of a successful appeal can
spread like wildfire.
¥ Split or merger of property.
¥ Change of purpose - commercial to domestic.
¥ Holiday lets.
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO
ABOUT MY CASE
Interactions with the VOA:
¥ First contact calls are typically relaxed.
¥ Customers like to talk directly to the VOA for
clarification.
¥ Band increases due to improvements to the
property by a previous owner CR10s are nearly
always a surprise.
¥ All requests are confirmed in writing. Either by
email or letter.
¥ For reviews when the owner has lived in their
property beyond 6 months CR15s, there is a spike
in reviews when the bills go out.
¥ If an agent is used, there is very little interaction
with the VOA. People going down this route are
often "chancing their arm" or "just having a go".
¥ Agents are bad at telling people the outcome of
their case.
¥ People do use the VOA website to see info about
other properties in their area.
¥ Most people will either call the Local Authority or
the VOA first before looking at any other
information.
Frustrations:
Calls:
¥ Call backs - "I can't sit by the phone all day waiting
for a call back".
Website:
¥ It is hard to find forms on the gov.uk site.
Process:
¥ Customers are confused by the process and
terminology.
¥ They can be intimidated by the VOA's legal
language.
¥ It can be hard for customers to understand what is
defined as an annexe. This is a significant area of
frustration.
¥ New builds might not have a band and so get put
on an emergency band. This can be a higher cost
than customers were expecting.
¥ It can be very hard for customers to find evidence
to support their case. "why won't the VOA share
this with us?"
¥ People report that the first thing they hear after
submitting an appeal is an invitation to Tribunal.
This is unexpected and frightening.
¥ There is very little guidance on how the process
works.
¥ The basis of the VOA's decision is often not clear
¥ It is felt that the Tribunal is used to make decisions
that the VOA should make themselves.
¥ It can be a stressful and distressing experience for
some. They report feeling powerless.
¥ Inspections are sometimes done from the outside.
Customers feel that this is not sufficient to
understand their property and how it differs from
those of their neighbours.
¥ Holiday lets pay Business Rates. The council has
to seek to assess whether the property is lived in
or not. This is not well understood.
Updates:
¥ The VOA provide no updates to customers
throughout the process.
¥ The contact centre are unable to provide updates.
¥ Customers get very little contact from the VOA.
VOA staffing:
¥ Cases can be handled by case officers in distant
regions. This can upset customers; "How can they
know anything about my situation?"
¥ Customers want to have a reasonable
conversation, but it seems to be very hard to get to
talk to anyone.
VOA attitude:
¥ Customers report a level of inflexibility on the part
of the VOA; "Once the VOA have made up their
mind, that's that".
Needs:
¥ Help and guidance on all aspects of the process.
¥ An indication of timescales.
¥ A quick outcome.
¥ For new builds, for the CT band to be set up
quickly.
¥ To be able to get CT estimates online.
¥ Explain more in the initial re-banding letter.
Customers don't want to have to call or get into a
panic.
¥ 24 hour call backs are ok, but it would be better if
customers could get an answer when they call the
first time.
¥ A quick and efficient service. "Why must it take
months".
¥ Explain the process. Help customers to
understand what is expected and when.
¥ Provide worked examples of appeals to
demonstrate how it works.
¥ If customers understood why their band was set at
the level it was and it seemed reasonable, they
would be less likely to appeal. They would also be
less aggrieved if they did appeal and the appeal
failed.

A journey map shows the path that a customer takes to achieve a
specific goal. The map shows all the steps that the customer takes
from the point at which their journey begins, through to when their
goal is achieved, and in some cases illustrating what may happen
beyond that point. This is often referred to as an end-to-end
journey.
Rather than consider a journey as beginning when a customer
comes into contact with the VOA, our end-to-end journeys consider
the totality of the experience, starting from the trigger that caused
the customer to begin their journey, through any interactions they
may have with other organisations or media before arriving at the
VOA. The journeys then cover all the interaction points with the
VOA, both online and offline, before either concluding or moving
beyond the VOA into interaction with other organisations.
There are a number of key components to the journey maps:
¥ Narrative: a description of the interaction that is occurring at key
points during the journey.
¥ Roles: they key people with whom the customer will interact on
their journey. On the journey maps these are shown as the
horizontal lines across the map.
¥ Channels: these are the different routes through which the
customer can interact with the VOA. This could include the
contact centre, the website, direct contact with caseworkers and
so on. Each interaction point in a specific channel is marked as a
node on the journey map.
¥ Path: the route taken through the journey.
¥ VOA documents: any documentation or online reference sources
that the customer will see during their journey. Any issues with
these sources will be detailed.
¥ Emotions: this illustrates how the customer, and other key roles,
are feeling during the process. This is where the main point
points in a journey will be captured, typically coinciding with the
more negative emotional states.
¥ VOA objectives: this section describes any VOA objectives that
result in the journey proceeding as it does. It is important to bear
these in mind when changes to the journey are considered to
ensure that changes address both VOA and customer needs.
By understanding the journey that a customer goes on when
interacting with the VOA, we can identify the key pain points, those
areas where interaction is more difficult than it needs to be, any
areas of inefficiency and highlight any unintended or unanticipated
interactions. By viewing the journeys from a role perspective, we
can also understand how much communication and guidance the
customer receives from the VOA during their journey, which has
been a recurring issue identified throughout our research.
