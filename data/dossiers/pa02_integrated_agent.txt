VOA's SoC can contain evidence that we're not
aware of and can change the path of the
appeal.
¥ It takes time to collect evidence for a SoC.
¥ Getting evidence comes down to personal
contacts.
Sometimes the margin is too small and the
effort to go to appeal means it isn't financially
worth it.
¥ If a reduction is over 5% then the VOA won't
sign it off without going to tribunal.
¥ The VOA cherry picks the information they
want to share.
¥ The VOA do everything they can to keep the RV
as high as they can.
¥ If we don't know the basis of the VOA case how
can we negotiate?
¥ Even on simple cases you have to appeal with
all the effort that goes with that.
The VOA say they are fair but they are not. They
used to be.
¥ Having our cases passed around internally in
the VOA is a huge frustration and causes
issues as case knowledge is lost.
¥ Our clients get very frustrated with the
process.
¥ The VOA are far more process driven than they
used to be. They no longer think sensibly.
¥ The VOA are under resourced.
¥ Some in the VOA take delight in hiding behind
regulations.
¥ The VOA make simple cases difficult. They put
things in for appeal when it is clear the rates
are wrong.
¥ The VOA has a culture of fear. Staff are not
empowered and they are scared of giving
discounts.
¥ Even when we are in agreement it can take far
too long for this to be actioned.
¥ The VOA will under value to protect against
appeals.
¥ Some cases take time to be allocated. We have
no idea who to deal with while this is going on.
¥ There is a huge backlog of cases and we think
that in certain instances the VOA are
purposefully not listing things. This has been
exacerbated by the edict from George Osborne
to fix the backlog. The VOA is too focused on
hitting this target reduction.
¥ The VOA data should really include GPS
coordinates, as it can sometimes be hard to
locate a property exactly
¥ The way that the VOA website captures
addresses doesn't always reflect how
addresses are structured. This can make it
harder to find properties in the system.
¥ Feel that valuers are reluctant to make
professional judgements and would prefer the
VT decided for them.
¥ Proposals will often get made invalid for no
good reason. It can be very hard to work out
why and make the necessary corrections or
challenge the reasoning. Maybe this is a
delaying tactic?
¥ Feel that the properties they represent
contribute a much more significant proportion
of RV than those of smaller organisations. If all
cases are treated equally, they end up with a
poor service that feels unwarranted.
¥ There is a concern that valuers can act
unprofessionally. Either by:
¥ Under-valuing properties to protect
against future reductions so an
increase can be threatened if the
ratepayer appeals
¥ Adding the wrong things to valuations to
protect against reductions.
¥ Hiding line items of a valuation within
¥ Feel that people are under pressure not
to lose too much value out of the list
rather than to achieve the correct
valuation.
¥ The VOA treats every case as the same and
won't prioritise the more complex ones.
PROCESS
STATEMENT OF CASE
It is very hard to get hold of a case worker. It is
just as hard to get a reply. It can feel like case
workers are hiding from you.
¥ The lack of communication puts pressure on
everyone.
¥ When you make your appeal you cannot give
your client any idea on the date it will be
heard.
¥ We often have to escalate to get a result. This
takes a lot of hard work and time.
¥ The VOA call centre system is frustrating."I
want to talk to the case worker that wrote to
me but I can't be put through and have to wait
for a call back from someone to tell me they
can't help me and to arrange for the person I
called for to call me."
¥ Direct dials are rarely given out.
¥ We are not told when our case workers go on
holiday. When they go away work on our cases
stops.
¥ Too much information is forgotten about or
lost.
¥ It is hard to get hold of anyone after 4pm.
¥ We give no information in proposals because
we don't have to. When we have provided the
information the VOA aren't interested anyway.
It's getting harder to have a productive
discussion to reach an agreement. VOA staff
are reluctant to talk to us.
¥ Feel that you have to put in an appeal to get
anyone at the VOA to speak to you. This has
made things much more adversarial.
¥ The VOA are reluctant to engage beyond the
target date. Simply respond, "we await your
case".
¥ Even if we have the correct contact details,
phones ring out and email inboxes bounce our
emails.
It costs a lot of money to go to tribunal £100k.
¥ The VT panel are not property specialists and
can not always see compelling evidence for
what it is. Therefore there are a lot of wrong
decisions made.
¥ When a case gets a tribunal date it comes out of
the blue and it is all systems go. This is
demanding on us and sometimes our clients.
Some cases take years to get to VT.
¥ Sometimes the VOA send people who know
nothing about the case to tribunal.
Valuation Tribunals have targets on listings, not
on resolutions. This colours how things work.
¥ Volume agents ride on the back of our work.
Once we get a win they exploit it in the area via
their marketing team.
¥ Worry that the blanket appeals type of agents
have put the VOA under such pressure that
they've gone into a defensive mode. Also
concerned that they've yet to develop a strategy
to combat them.
¥ There is a concern that the VOA now think that
all agents are crooks.
COMMUNICATION
VALUATION
TRIBUNAL
VOLUME AGENTS
¥ Feel that the knowledge base of the VOA is in
decline.
Younger VOA staff are not well skilled and
don't know what they are talking about.
Feel that the VOA workforce is becoming less
skilled. This can make first contact more
difficult.
¥ The local knowledge has gone. VOA staff used
to know a property and its rating history. This
made discussions much more productive. Now
a case may go to Tribunal as a consequence
when agreement could have been reached, or
go around the loop until someone with the
right expertise is assigned to the case.
¥ We don't have access to the rental information
the VOA has used to decide their valuation.
This makes it hard to understand if the RV is
correct.
In the NDR space, the primary audience
group that the VOA interacts with is that of
ratings agents. Around 90% of NDR payers
are represented by an agent, which makes
this an important group to understand. The
agent marketplace is quite varied however,
ranging from lone surveyors, up to
multi-national consultancy firms who
provide ratings advice as just one of many
property related services.
Recognising this variation, it would be less
useful to have a single agent persona, as
whilst there are many common needs, there
are some important differences. During the
course of our research we have identified
four different categories of agents:

target. This illustrates why there us such tension between Volume

JAMES THOMAS
PROFILE
¥ Typically the integrated agent will be in a small
team in a much larger organisation.
¥ They are professionally qualified with either IRRV
or RICS.
¥ Their clients are larger than those of other agents.
They work with large UK based or multi-national
organisations.
¥ For the multi-nationals they are often helping to
manage large property transactions in the UK and
understand the implications of ratings for these
organisation.
¥ Their focus is on providing due diligence in all
property dealings for their clients.
¥ They are well supported by their organisation and
there are other surveyors in the organisation, who
they will work with, but who aren't part of their
team.
¥ They do not submit a high volume of appeals. They
will only submit an appeal once they know all the
facts and believe there is merit in the case. The
only exception to this is if they get a new client
close to a list closing. In which case they will
appeal and then withdraw their case if it has no
merit.
¥ Most of their clients only have a few properties, but
these properties will have very large Rateable
Values. These will be large and complex properties,
such as:
¥ Power stations
¥ Large offices
¥ Large hotels
¥ Car factories
¥ Rateable values for large properties can work on a
very different basis for example capital costs for
the build. This can make it very useful to have the
expertise of the larger organisation to draw upon.
¥ Clients can come direct, or as part of the service
provided by the wider business. It is mostly the
latter.
INTEGRATED AGENTS WILL TYPICALLY SIT WITHIN A LARGE, POTENTIALLY MULTI-NATIONAL, CONSULTANCY BASED
ORGANISATION THAT PROVIDES RATINGS ADVICE ALONGSIDE A PORTFOLIO OF OTHER SERVICES. THE TYPE OF
ORGANISATION THEY WORK FOR HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY WORK WITH. GENERALLY
THIS WILL BE LARGE CORPORATES, WHOSE PROPERTIES COMMAND SIGNIFICANT RATEABLE VALUES. THIS MEANS THAT
THEIR RATINGS TEAMS WILL OFTEN HAVE DEEP SPECIALISMS IN HANDLING LARGE OR COMPLEX PROPERTY VALUATIONS.
THEY CONSEQUENTLY EXPECT TO SPEAK TO EXPERTS IN THE VOA WHO HAVE A SIMILAR FOCUS.
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THEIR CLIENTS THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY TIME PRESSURED, BUT WILL ERR HEAVILY ON THE
SIDE OF QUALITY AND THOROUGHNESS. THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO DRAW ON THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF THEIR
WIDER ORGANISATION, OFTEN HAVING ACCESS TO OTHER TAX OR RELATED PROPERTY SPECIALISTS. THIS CAN MAKE
THEM A QUITE FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY, SHOULD THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN DISPUTE WITH THE VOA.
AS WITH ALL AGENTS, THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE VOA THAT THEY FIND FRUSTRATING, BUT
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE RIGHT VOA EXPERT, THEY FEEL THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS PRODUCTIVE. THEIR
BIGGEST CHALLENGE, HOWEVER, IS REACHING THAT PERSON TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION.
WE PREFER TO WORK
WITH, AND WILL WORK
TO ESCALATE OUR CASES
TO MORE SENIOR
PEOPLE AT THE VOA
VOA INTERACTIONS
¥ A lot of time is spent at the moment talking to the
VOA and clients about empty rates.
¥ They are typically looking to have a professional
discussion with the VOA. As a consequence,
contact over the phone is preferred.
¥ Of all agents, they have the most collaborative
relationship with the VOA. They will often meet VOA
staff at a property and will then help them to
measure. As a consequence the VOA will share
their handwritten survey, which is really helpful.
¥ They do use the VOA website, but will refer to third
party tools when this is insufficient. The Analyse
tool is felt to be particularly good.
¥ They interact with people at all levels in the VOA.
This can include:
¥ Referencers
¥ Caseworkers
¥ Technical advisors
¥ Policy team
¥ However, they will often seek to have cases
escalated to a higher level within the VOA as
they're more complex.
¥ As with all agents, they maintain their own contact
database. However, even with this they will
sometimes have to ring around their known
contacts to find someone who can refer them to
the right person for a specific case.
¥ Their feeling is that the VOA are more inclined to
share data for the more complex cases.
CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS
¥ Sometimes clients will try to handle ratings
appeals by themselves and they end up stepping in
to fix what's happened.
¥ Most client interaction is via email, especially for
clients who aren't based in the UK.
¥ It's rare to get too much information from the
client.
UNIQUE CHALLENGES
Feel that the properties they represent contribute a
much more significant proportion of RV than those
of smaller organisations. If all cases are treated
equally, they end up with a poor service that feels
unwarranted.

during our research against the different audience groups who
engage with the VOA. By understanding where different needs are
concentrated the VOA can better design processes and systems to
support those needs. The mapping also shows where particular

A better transition from LA to VOA
require more information and
guidance.
A journey map shows the path that a customer takes to achieve a
specific goal. The map shows all the steps that the customer takes
from the point at which their journey begins, through to when their
goal is achieved, and in some cases illustrating what may happen
beyond that point. This is often referred to as an end-to-end
journey.
Rather than consider a journey as beginning when a customer
comes into contact with the VOA, our end-to-end journeys consider
the totality of the experience, starting from the trigger that caused
the customer to begin their journey, through any interactions they
may have with other organisations or media before arriving at the
VOA. The journeys then cover all the interaction points with the
VOA, both online and offline, before either concluding or moving
beyond the VOA into interaction with other organisations.
There are a number of key components to the journey maps:
¥ Narrative: a description of the interaction that is occurring at key
points during the journey.
¥ Roles: they key people with whom the customer will interact on
their journey. On the journey maps these are shown as the
horizontal lines across the map.
¥ Channels: these are the different routes through which the
customer can interact with the VOA. This could include the
contact centre, the website, direct contact with caseworkers and
so on. Each interaction point in a specific channel is marked as a
node on the journey map.
¥ Path: the route taken through the journey.
¥ VOA documents: any documentation or online reference sources
that the customer will see during their journey. Any issues with
these sources will be detailed.
¥ Emotions: this illustrates how the customer, and other key roles,
are feeling during the process. This is where the main point
points in a journey will be captured, typically coinciding with the
more negative emotional states.
¥ VOA objectives: this section describes any VOA objectives that
result in the journey proceeding as it does. It is important to bear
these in mind when changes to the journey are considered to
ensure that changes address both VOA and customer needs.
By understanding the journey that a customer goes on when
interacting with the VOA, we can identify the key pain points, those
areas where interaction is more difficult than it needs to be, any
areas of inefficiency and highlight any unintended or unanticipated
interactions. By viewing the journeys from a role perspective, we
can also understand how much communication and guidance the
customer receives from the VOA during their journey, which has
been a recurring issue identified throughout our research.
