LOCAL AUTHORITY
ROLE:
CASES THEY ARE THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR A COUNCIL TAX PAYER OR RATEPAYER WHEN THEY HAVE A PROPERTY
RELATED ENQUIRY. IN THIS CONTEXT, MUCH OF WHAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY DOES AT THIS POINT CAN FRAME THE JOUR
NEY THAT THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE WITH THE VOA.
THE VOLUME OF ENQUIRIES A LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL RECEIVE IS, UNSURPRISINGLY, GOVERNED BY ITS SIZE AND THE
COMPOSITION OF RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS PREMISES WITHIN ITS BOUNDARY. THE LARGER AUTHORITIES WILL RE
CEIVE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF CONTACT OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH, WITH ONE AUTHORITY REPORTING 2,500 NDR
CALLS AND 12,500 CT CALLS.
DUE TO CHANGES IN THE WAY LAS ARE FUNDED THEY CAN KEEP UP TO 50% OF THE BUSINESS RATE CHARGES THEY COL
LECT. THESE CHANGES WERE DRIVEN BY GOVERNMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE MORE CONTROL TO LAS OVER THEIR
FUNDING. THE PREMISE BEING - THE MORE WORK LAS PUT IN TO BUSINESS RATES THE MORE FUNDING THEY RECEIVE. SO
FAR RESULTS HAVE BEEN MIXED, SOME LAS HAVE BOUGHT INTO IT MORE THAN OTHERS. PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS
MORE DOMESTIC PROPERTY THAN NON DOMESTIC PROPERTY AS THERE IS LITTLE SCOPE FOR CHANGE.
THE CHANGES IN FUNDING MEAN LAS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES THE VOA MAKE TO RATEABLE VALUE.
THEREFORE THEY HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN THE VOA AND ITS WORK.
Interactions with customers
The majority of contact with CT and NDR customers
is around billing or billing enforcement. A small
proportion of this customer contact will require that
the customer be referred to the VOA. Those Local
Authorities that have a good relationship with the VOA
appear to be well versed in what types of query
should be referred and to whom.
Ratings agents do interact with the LA, but this
seems to be mainly in terms of gaining access to
information, via FOI requests, that would give them a
competitive advantage. The Local Authorities don't
have any interaction with Council Tax agents, but
some will send out periodic leaflets warning people
about cowboy agents.

Main goals
Owing to the impact it has on their funding, Local
Authorities are most concerned with Business Rates
and Rates Retention. This drives them to have as
complete an understanding of the ratings list as
possible. In particular they are very keen to under
stand, well in advance, any changes that may be
made to the list, particularly where rateable values
are being reduced, or properties are being removed
from the list. They are also keen to ensure that new
properties are added to the list in as timely a manner
as possible.
VOA interactions
Local Authorities paint a varied picture of VOA
interaction. Some are very happy with the level
collaboration they have with the VOA, citing good
communications and co-inspection of properties.
Others appear to have less direct contact and so their
experience of the VOA is not as positive.
The LARMs are universally praised. However they
only work at a high level. There is a desire for
increased contact on an operational level. Some LAs
have achieved this and are very happy with how this
works. If this could be a universal practice then
satisfaction within the LAs would be increased.
WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THE
VOA HAS REALLY GRASPED
THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS
AND THE WAY WE WORK
Frustrations
Forecasting is a major activity and the LAs rely on the
VOA to keep them informed of potential changes to
the list. If the VOA fail to inform the LA of large
changes, this can be extremely problematic.
The lack of data sharing in recent years is felt to
make things more difficult than they need to be.
Particularly when it comes to identifying who is
occupying a property. The LAs understand why the
VOA cannot share this information, but it makes it no
less frustrating.
Outcomes of appeals are a cause of frustration as
they can lead to revenue losses. Frustration is driven
by the low influence LAs have over appeals in their
region. The slow speed of the appeals process is
another frustration exacerbating LA concerns.
Communicating with the VOA
Most contact with the VOA is by phone and email, as
well as through the regular provision of the schedule
via the Backtrans system.
LA customers most valued:
¥ Collaboration wherever possible.
LA customers were most frustrated by:
¥ The lack of data sharing.
¥ Instances where timely notification of changes to
the list don't occur.
¥ To a lesser extent, errors on the schedule and the
time it takes to correct them.
¥ The speed of appeals and the financial impact of
rate reductions.

The following section maps the various user needs identified
during our research against the different audience groups who
engage with the VOA. By understanding where different needs are
concentrated the VOA can better design processes and systems to
support those needs. The mapping also shows where particular
audience groups may have unique needs for which the VOA should
consider making specific provision.

The switch board to be able to put

A better transition from LA to VOA
require more information and
guidance.
A journey map shows the path that a customer takes to achieve a
specific goal. The map shows all the steps that the customer takes
from the point at which their journey begins, through to when their
goal is achieved, and in some cases illustrating what may happen
beyond that point. This is often referred to as an end-to-end
journey.
Rather than consider a journey as beginning when a customer
comes into contact with the VOA, our end-to-end journeys consider
the totality of the experience, starting from the trigger that caused
the customer to begin their journey, through any interactions they
may have with other organisations or media before arriving at the
VOA. The journeys then cover all the interaction points with the
VOA, both online and offline, before either concluding or moving
beyond the VOA into interaction with other organisations.
There are a number of key components to the journey maps:
¥ Narrative: a description of the interaction that is occurring at key
points during the journey.
¥ Roles: they key people with whom the customer will interact on
their journey. On the journey maps these are shown as the
horizontal lines across the map.
¥ Channels: these are the different routes through which the
customer can interact with the VOA. This could include the
contact centre, the website, direct contact with caseworkers and
so on. Each interaction point in a specific channel is marked as a
node on the journey map.
¥ Path: the route taken through the journey.
¥ VOA documents: any documentation or online reference sources
that the customer will see during their journey. Any issues with
these sources will be detailed.
¥ Emotions: this illustrates how the customer, and other key roles,
are feeling during the process. This is where the main point
points in a journey will be captured, typically coinciding with the
more negative emotional states.
¥ VOA objectives: this section describes any VOA objectives that
result in the journey proceeding as it does. It is important to bear
these in mind when changes to the journey are considered to
ensure that changes address both VOA and customer needs.
By understanding the journey that a customer goes on when
interacting with the VOA, we can identify the key pain points, those
areas where interaction is more difficult than it needs to be, any
areas of inefficiency and highlight any unintended or unanticipated
interactions. By viewing the journeys from a role perspective, we
can also understand how much communication and guidance the
customer receives from the VOA during their journey, which has
been a recurring issue identified throughout our research.
